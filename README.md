## Features

*	VVM ESP32 4G LTE Module is an ultra-low power embedded SoC designed for high-speed wireless communication. It integrates the latest LTE module standards and provides a host of features such as advanced modulation and coding technologies, flexible antenna configurations, and high-speed radio transmission
*	Easy migration from 2G/3G network to 4G network now made possible using this module. Network providers are in the process of shutting down support for 2G /3G and businesses relying on wireless communication are hurrying to transition to 4G LTE connectivity. Legacy devices still relying on 2G/3G can be upgraded to 4G networks and made IoT/ Industry 4.0 ready.
*	ESP-WROOM-32 30 PIN Development Board which has a dual 32-bit CPU is coupled with 4G LTE wireless communication module SIM7670C
*	The module uses one of the popular 4G LTE chipset A7670C by SIMCOM. The SIM7670C is Multi-Band LTE-TDD/LTE-FDD/HSPA+ and GSM/GPRS/EDGE module solution in an SMT type which supports LTE CAT1 up to 10Mbps for download data transfer
*	The preconfigured AT commands of A7670C makes it easier for the user to communicate via MQTT, SMS, Calls etc.
*	ESP32-WROOM-32 is a powerful, generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + Bluetooth LE MCU module that targets a wide variety of applications, ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks, such as IoT applications, voice encoding, music streaming and MP3 decoding
*	Indian 4G bands can be used with this module. This means it can be used with Jio, Airtel, Vodafone networks, etc. 
*	The board supports multiple built-in network protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, MQTT along with SMS and calls
*	The board is powered using a Type- C connector and requires a regulated 5V/2A power source 
*	On-board fuse protection, transient voltage protection  and EMI suppression
*	VVM LTE 4G module come with antennas that allow for better reception and faster data speeds.
*	Automatic switchover to 2G/EDGE in absence of LTE.
*	On-board USB connector, SIM card connector, antenna connector and additional PCB connector for User Interface
## Applications
  Supports multiple network bands and can be used in a variety of applications including IoT applications, Telematics, Surveillance Devices, PoS, Industrial Routers, Remote Diagnostics, MQTT gateways, etc. Legacy devices still relying on 2G/3G can be upgraded to 4G networks and made IoT/ Industry 4.0 ready.
